ViewSet classes are almost the same thing as View classes, except that they provide operations such as read, or update, and not method handlers such as get or put.

A ViewSet class is only bound to a set of method handlers at the last moment, when it is instantiated into a set of views, typically by using a Router class which handles the complexities of defining the URL conf for you.
